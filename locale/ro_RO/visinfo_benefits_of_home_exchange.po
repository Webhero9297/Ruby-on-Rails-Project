# --- English text = Home exchange is the most authentic approach to living in a foreign country or culture. You find yourself immersed in your exchange partner's culture and lifestyle. The chances are excellent that you will meet their neighbours or friends. You will discover local stores, sights and flavour. This is a personalized and realistic travel experience that can't be beat.  Many exchange families remain friends long after their exchange, keeping up with each other's families per telephone and email.

# --- English text = Go ahead, imagine your luggage from your last holiday.   Open it up, and remove all the stuff you took, because you might need it.  Now, dare to imagine this:  You are exchanging with a family in Sweden, and they have kids the same ages as yours.  Just as adults enjoy driving a holiday car, kids delight in a temporary toy exchange.  There will be something for everyone: a different "favorite coffee cup", different books to read at bedtime, movies you might not have seen or music you haven't heard.  These are all a part of your exchange partner's every day lifestyle and they are available for your use at your exchange partner's home.

In plus, participati la dezvoltarea economica locala , facandu-va cumparaturile de la producatorii si comenciantii locali. Astfel , schimband casa ,va petreceti vacantele intr-un mod mult mai responsabil si mai ecologic."
