# --- English text = Intervac has two different types of references: confirmed and unconfirmed.  A confirmed reference is of course the best as it states that both parties have confirmed thier good will.  The label confirmed reference is given when the reference giver has chosen <highlight>Yes</highlight> to the question: <highlight>Act as Reference?</highlight> and the reference receiver has chosen <highlight>Yes</highlight> to the question <highlight>Allow as Reference?</highlight>

msgid "why_unconfirmed.headline"
msgstr "Why are some references unconfirmed?"

# --- English text = Unconfirmed references are usually because either the member's exchange partner has not yet specifically chosen <highlight>Yes</highlight> or <highlight>No</highlight> to the question <highlight>Act as Reference?</highlight>, or it relates to an older exchange and the other member does not currently have an active membership. This could be the case especially with exchanges before April, 2011 when we launched the expanded version of our Exchange Agreements and Member References modules.
