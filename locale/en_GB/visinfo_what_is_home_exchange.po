msgstr "What is Home Exchange?"

# --- English text = ...home exchange is an act of international trust and cooperation at the individual level that one has to experience to really understand. It is important for me to move the exchange beyond a "free hotel/car" arrangement by careful preparation for receiving our exchange guests in our community ...including meeting friends, family or professionals with a common bond.

# --- English text = Home exchange simply means that you and your family agree with a family from a different area to live in each other's homes during your holiday. The length of the holiday exchange is entirely up to you.  Only have a free weekend?  Arrange a weekend exchange. No money changes hands between the exchangers so you can have free accommodation anywhere in the world.
