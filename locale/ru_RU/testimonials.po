We exchanged homes with a couple from Mississauga (Canada)and what a wonderful experience it has been: charming people, generous and welcoming, beautiful home, great car. When we had to extend our stay because of the volcanic ash cloud, they never objected, on the contrary. For our first Intervac experience, we have been more that lucky, we have been positively blessed!!!
