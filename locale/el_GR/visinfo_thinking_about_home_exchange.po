# --- English text = How Do I Find The Perfect Exchange Partner?
# (June 2011) 
msgid "perfect_partner.headline"
msgstr "Πώς μπορώ να οργανώσω την τέλεια ανταλλαγή;"

# --- English text = First, it's important to know that it takes some initiative to make an exchange happen.  We try to make it as simple as possible though.  Our members contact each other directly using our integrated messaging system to start a dialog that could lead to an exchange.  It is not unusual to make and receive several offers  before you find just the right partner.  Our online system supports many different types of alternative holiday forms.

msgstr "Πρώτ'απ'όλα πρέπει να ξέρετε ότι για να γίνει μια ανταλλαγή κάποιος πρέπει να αναπτύξει πρωτοβουλία. Εμείς βέβαια διευκολύνουμε τη διαδικασία. Τα μέλη μας επικοινωνούν μεταξύ τους χρησιμοποιώντας τον ιστοτόπο μας και αρχίζουν μια επικοινωνία που μπορεί να οδηγήσει στην ανταλλαγή. Συνήθως κανείς στέλνει και λαμβάνει πολλές προσφορές πριν βρει αυτό που θέλει. Το διαδικτυακό μας σύστημα υποστηρίζει πολλούς διαφορετικούς εναλλακτικούς τύπους διακοπών."

# --- English text = How can I be sure that the exchange will be <italic>equal</italic>?
# (June 2011)
msgid "equal_exchange.headline"
msgstr "Πώς μπορώ να είμαι σίγουρος ότι η ανταλλαγή θα είναι \"ισότιμη\"?"

# --- English text = Many exchangers with large homes would be happy to trade for an adequate apartment/condominium in central Paris, London, Rome or San Francisco.  Others are looking for a quiet getaway.  An exchange is "equal" when both parties are satisfied with their arrangements. 
# (June 2011)
msgid "equal_exchange.text"
msgstr "Πολλά μέλη με μεγάλα σπίτι θα ήταν πολύ ευτυχή να βρουν και να ανταλλάξουν με ένα επαρκές διαμέρισμα στο κεντρικό Παρίσι, Λονδίνο, Ρώμη ή Σαν Φρανσίσκο. Άλλοι ψάχνουν μια ήσυχη γωνιά. Μια ανταλλαγή είναι \"ισότιμη\" όταν και τα δύο μέρη είναι ικανοποιημένα από τη συμφωνία."

# --- English text = Who would ever want to come to my area?
# (June 2011)
msgid "visit_my_area.headline"
msgstr "Ποιός θα ενδιαφερόταν να έρθει στην περιοχή μου;"

# --- English text = You'll be surprised!  Take some time writing extra text for your listing and tell potential exchange partners all about your neighborhood, why you love living there, what can they see and do in the region.  Don't forget, your partner will be on holiday and has time to explore.  Everyone lives near something interesting, because "interesting" is often nothing more than the unfamiliar.
# (June 2011)
msgid "visit_my_area.text"
msgstr "Θα εκπλαγείτε ευχάριστα! Αφιερώστε λίγο χρόνο να γράψετε λίγα πράγματα προβάλλοντας την περιοχή σας και να πείτε σε πιθανούς ενδιαφερόμενους τα πάντα για τη γειτονιά σας, γιατί σας αρέσει να ζείτε εκεί, τι μπορέι να δεί και να κάνεις κανείς στην περιοχή. Μην ξεχνάτε ότι στις διακοπές οι άνθρωποι έχουν χρόνο και τους αρέσει να εξερευνούν. Όλοι ζούμε κοντά σε κάτι ενδιαφέρον, καθώς \"ενδιαφέρον\" είναι απλά αυτό που δεν ξέρουμε."

msgstr "What about exchanging cars?"

# --- English text = In many cases an exchange of cars is an important part of the exchange deal, but not always.  It's a good idea to think clearly about whether you are comfortable driving in New York City or London.

# --- English text = As for insurance, often your car insurance policy will already cover guest drivers. If it doesn't you can supplement your regular policy with additional short-term specific coverage for the length of your exchange. It is important to discuss this with your insurance agent and your exchange partner and agree in advance how to handle the responsibilities and liabilities for the financial aspect.

msgstr "Speaking of insurance, what about my home insurance?"

# --- English text = Do check with your insurance provider and let them know that you will have guests while you are gone. Most companies will tell you that an unoccupied home is a bigger risk for theft and vandalism than an occupied one and they are happy to know that yours won't be sitting empty while you are away.  Ask if there are any special arrangements you need to make, and don't forget to let your exchange partner know about any insurance requirements for locking doors, activating alarm systems, etc.  This should be included in the information packet about your home that you will leave for them.
