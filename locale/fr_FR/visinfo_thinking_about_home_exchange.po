# --- English text = You'll be surprised!  Take some time writing extra text for your listing and tell potential exchange partners all about your neighborhood, why you love living there, what can they see and do in the region.  Don't forget, your partner will be on holiday and has time to explore.  Everyone lives near something interesting, because "interesting" is often nothing more than the unfamiliar.

# --- English text = As for insurance, often your car insurance policy will already cover guest drivers. If it doesn't you can supplement your regular policy with additional short-term specific coverage for the length of your exchange. It is important to discuss this with your insurance agent and your exchange partner and agree in advance how to handle the responsibilities and liabilities for the financial aspect.

# --- English text = Do check with your insurance provider and let them know that you will have guests while you are gone. Most companies will tell you that an unoccupied home is a bigger risk for theft and vandalism than an occupied one and they are happy to know that yours won't be sitting empty while you are away.  Ask if there are any special arrangements you need to make, and don't forget to let your exchange partner know about any insurance requirements for locking doors, activating alarm systems, etc.  This should be included in the information packet about your home that you will leave for them.
