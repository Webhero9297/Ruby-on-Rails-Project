Regarding active listing reminder e-mails

Some day ago we sent out reminders to members that had not been logged in for some time.

Because of an error in the e-mail routine, some members that had been logged in also received the same reminder.
We are truly sorry for this and has made sure this will not happen again.

Sincerely yours, Intervac
